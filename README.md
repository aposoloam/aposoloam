# College Student Who Can't Wait to Work!
After getting my Associates of Science from a local community college (money saved!) I transferred to a 4-year State School where I'm most interested in backend development and professionally applicable development pipelines.

# My Interests and Workflow:
I enjoy working with REST APIs more than anything else, so I regularly use this stack:
TypeScript as a main language
NestJS, Python + FastAPI as my backend
React and Next.js for frontend, yes I know my APIs are bloated bla bla bla
PostgreSQL + Prisma for relational databases

# My Philosophy as a Developer
I believe that programming has become too polarized between complete professional standards, and lawless, unstructured slop. My philosophy and work motivation stems from an increasingly rare middle ground. 

I believe that programming is inherently designed with structure and cleanliness in mind (I mean come on we're all nerds), but that approaching every little side project at an enterprise level is leading to more and more burnout in people who would otherwise be able to grow into great programmers. To avoid this, I like to believe I've reinforced a healthy, balanced dogma that allows me to grow as a programmer while mitigating any feelings of burnout or inadequacy. 

# My Philosophy on Teams
Although I'm still a student, and likely largely inspired by naivety, I try and take a "business casual" approach to programming. I strongly believe that bonding between teams can often become a bigger source of motivation than any other form of compensation, and as such I strive to connect and bond with everyone I work with.

By meeting my team members where they are at, I strive to uplift those around me with the goal of individual AND team growth and learning.
